About Fertilizer Recommendation System
With The Aim Of Sustainable Crop Production, Reduction In The Misuse Of Fertilizers And Reduction Of Input Cost By Optimizing The Present Pattern Of Excessive Fertilizer Application, Our Team Provides Fertilizer Recommendation Through Both The Manual And Soil Test Based Interpretation Of Plant Nutrients Through Soil Database And Static Laboratory Soil Analysis.

Our Team Has Developed Web-Based Software Named Fertilizer Recommendation System(FRS). The System Is Capable Of Generating Fertilizer Recommendations For Selected Crops By Analysing The Soil Database Developed.

The Software Requires Proportion Of Nutrients In Soil, Land Type, And Crop Type And Variety Information To Generate Crop-Specific Instant Fertilizer Recommendation.
